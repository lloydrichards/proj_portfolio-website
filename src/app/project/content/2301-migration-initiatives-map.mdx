The Migration Initiatives Map is an interactive map that showcases the projects
and initiatives in the field of migration in Niger. The map is a tool for the
International Organization for Migration (IOM) to visualize and communicate the
work they are doing in the region. The map is designed to be used by IOM staff,
partners, and the public to explore the projects and initiatives in the region.

Built with NextJS, Mapbox, and React, the map is a fully responsive web
application that works on all devices. The map is available in English and
French and is designed to be easy to use and navigate. The map is also
integrated with the IOM's content management system, allowing the IOM to easily
update and manage the content on the map.
