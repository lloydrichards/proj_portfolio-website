In collaboration with the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS), I worked on
the team developing a comprehensive cancer monitoring dashboard that transforms
complex statistical data into accessible, meaningful visualizations. This
project showcases our expertise in creating user-friendly data visualization
tools while addressing unique challenges in public health communication.

## Project Overview

The dashboard consisted of three main pages with around 8 different chart types
that showed statistical information about cancer incidence, deaths, and survival
rates. The data was provided by the BFS and was visualized in a way that was
easy to understand for the general public.

The development team split responsibilities across three main areas: Line
Charts, Table Charts, and Layout + Theming. We emphasized accessibility and
modularity by building charts using semantic HTML tables, though this approach
presented its own challenges in terms of flexible height and state management.

A significant achievement was the expansion of our `swiss-federal-ci` library,
which now acts as a component library, shared across multiple projects. This
standardization effort improved consistency and efficiency in development.

## Challenges and Insights

Throughout the project, we encountered and overcame several significant
challenges:

- Managing complex data representations, including the distinction between zero
  values and non-existent data
- Implementing sophisticated visual elements while maintaining accessibility
- Communicating technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders
- Ensuring absolute data accuracy, particularly important given the sensitive
  nature of health statistics

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights that will inform our future work:

- The importance of clear technical boundaries when working with non-technical
  clients
- The benefits of being flexible with initial project specifications when it
  serves the end product
- The value of thorough planning and independent architecture decisions

## Impact

The Cancer Monitoring Dashboard represents a significant step forward in making
public health data more accessible and understandable. It serves as a crucial
tool for both healthcare professionals and the public, while maintaining the
highest standards of data accuracy and user accessibility.
