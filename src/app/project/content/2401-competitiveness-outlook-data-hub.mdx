The OECD South East Europe Regional Programme (SEERP) helps communicate the
recent successes and challenges for policymakers in each region. The SEERP's
work is important for boosting competitiveness and regional integration in the
Western Balkans, in line with the region's EU agenda.

The OECD Competitiveness Data Hub is an important digital platform designed to
make its 2024 report more accessible, engaging, and actionable for policymakers
and the public. As a developer, I led the technical decisions for the platform,
assuring that the data was accurately visualised and that the user experience
was well received. The application is used by policymakers in the Western
Balkans to make informed decisions as they strive for alignment with EU
standards.

## Challenges and Insights

### Data Visualization Complexity

The most significant challenge was designing the visualisation system for the
data point, where everything needed to be visible even when overlapping. Using
D3.js to create SVG charts along with scaling and vector calculations, I was
able to ensure that all data remained accurate and visually clear, even in dense
regions of the dataset.

### Multi-Channel Adaptability

Creating a cohesive user experience across platforms required innovative
approaches. While the web visualisation was the client's core focus, ensuring
that the responsive design retained the core experience was also important.

### Collaboration in a High-Stakes Environment

Working with the OECD introduced unique challenges, such as navigating
geopolitical sensitive topics like trade agreements and regional conflicts, and
balancing input from multiple stakeholders. Communication and flexibility were
essential to meeting the strict deadlines for the high-profile launch event in
Paris.

## Key Learnings

- Precision in Data Representation: Developing robust systems for handling
  complex datasets reinforced the importance of balancing flexibility with
  rigorous validation.
- Multi-Channel Design Strategy: From the beginning, designing with multiple
  platforms and formats in mind was crucial for ensuring consistency and
  scalability.
- Stakeholder Collaboration: Navigating a multi-stakeholder project emphasised
  the need for clear communication, compromise, and agility to achieve ambitious
  goals.

## Impact

The report's launch was well received and has been an essential project
for 2024. My technical innovations directly contributed to making the OECD
Competitiveness Data Hub a user-friendly and powerful tool for policymakers
worldwide. The success of this platform shows the importance of visualising
complex economic data in an accessible way, helping policymakers to improve
competitiveness and regional integration in the Western Balkans.
