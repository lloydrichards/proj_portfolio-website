While volunteering for the Outlier Conf in 2021, I noticed the complexity of
getting the event schedule and speaker information out to participants. Due to
the global nature of the conference we had participants from almost every
timezone. So for the 2021 Conf, I decided to create an app to make it easier for
attendees to access the information. The app was built using Flutter and
Firebase, and was released on both the Google Play Store and the Apple App
Store.

The app was a huge success and was used by almost all of the attendees. It
allowed them to easily access the schedule, speaker information, and even add
Unconf events directly to the schedule. We were able to reuse the app for the
2023 conference with only minor updates.
