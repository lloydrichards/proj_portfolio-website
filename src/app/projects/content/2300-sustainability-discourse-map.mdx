The Sustainability Discourse Map is a data visualization of critical aspects of
the current and past discourse around urban sustainability in Z端rich. In
partnership with the
[Digital Society Initiative](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/en.html) of the University
of Z端rich, the map is based on a dataset of 1,000 articles from the
[Tages Anzeiger](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/) newspaper, and it is designed to
help researchers, policymakers, and the public understand the evolution of the
discourse around sustainability in Z端rich.

There are two main visualizations in the project, the first one is a Bubble Map
that shows the distribution of articles across different topics, and the second
one is a Bee Swarm Plot that shows the evolution of the discourse over time.

The map was built using `Next.js`, `D3.js`, and `React`. The data was processed
and provided through a REST API. Using `D3.js`, the data points were grouped and
simulated into a force-directed graph, which was then rendered in the browser.
The user can interact with the graph by panning and filtering the data points.
The user can also select a data point to view the article's content and
metadata.

The collaboration with the Digital Society Initiative was fast-paced and
iterative. The project was developed in two months, and the team worked closely
with the researchers to refine the visualizations and the user experience. In
order to quickly build out prototypes and test ideas, many of the visualizations
were first build as Labs here:

- [024 - Applying D3 Force in React](/labs/024-applying-d3-force-in-react)
- [026 - Optimized Nested Bubble Packing](/labs/26-optimized-nested-simulations)
- [030 - Animated Bee Swarm Chart](/labs/030-bee-swarm-chart)

These labs were then integrated into the final project, and the team was able to
deliver a high-quality product that met the needs of the researchers and the
public.
