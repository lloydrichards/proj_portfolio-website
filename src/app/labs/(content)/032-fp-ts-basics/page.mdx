## The Basics

I've been using `fp-ts` for a little over three years now and has been a
fundemental part of my development process. I've been using it in production for
the last two years and have been very happy with it. I've been using it in a
variety of projects, from small personal projects to large enterprise
applications. I've also been using it in a variety of languages, from TypeScript
to Dart.

While the majority of what I do with `fp-ts` is pretty standard, there are a few
things that I would like to improve upon. This series of posts will be a
collection of things that I've learned about `fp-ts` that I think are worth
sharing or exploring further.

## Primatives

### Array

The `Array` type is a primative that is used to represent a list of values. It
is a very common type in functional programming and is generally used to replace
`for` loops.

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as A from "fp-ts/lib/Array";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;
const square = (n: number): number => n * n;
const inc = (n: number): number => n + 1;

const doubleSquareAndInc = pipe(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  A.map(double), // apply the double function
  A.map(inc), // apply the inc function
  A.map(square), // apply the square function
);

console.log(doubleSquareAndInc); // Output: [ 9, 25, 49, 81, 121 ]
```

### Option

The `Option` type is a primative that is used to represent a value that may or
may not exist. It is a very common type in functional programming and is
generally used to replace `null` or `undefined` values.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import * as O from "fp-ts/lib/Option";

const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const square = (x: number): number => x ** 2;

// Map over the right value
const maybeNumber: O.Option<number> = O.some(3);

const result = pipe(
  maybeNumber, // start with an Option<number>
  O.map(double), // apply double function
  O.map(square), // apply square function
);

console.log(result); // Output: Some(36)
```

### Either

The `Either` type is a primative that is used to represent a value that may be
one of two types. It is a very common type in functional programming and is
generally used to replace `throw` statements.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe, flow } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import * as E from "fp-ts/lib/Either";

const divide = (x: number, y: number): E.Either<string, number> =>
  pipe(
    y,
    E.fromPredicate(
      (y) => y != 0,
      () => "Division by zero",
    ),
    E.map((y) => x / y),
  );

const squareRoot = (x: number): E.Either<string, number> =>
  pipe(
    x,
    E.fromPredicate(
      (x) => x < 0,
      () => "Cannot calculate square root of a negative number",
    ),
    E.map((x) => Math.sqrt(x)),
  );

const calculate = flow(
  divide, // Start with an Either<string, number>
  E.chain((value) => squareRoot(value)), // Apply squareRoot function
);

console.log(calculate(10, 2)); // Output: Right(2.5)
```

### Task

The `Task` type is a primative that is used to represent a value that may be
computed asynchronously. It is a very common type in functional programming and
is generally used to replace `Promise` objects.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/function";
import * as T from "fp-ts/Task";

const alwaysResolve: T.Task<number> = () => Promise.resolve(42);

const response = pipe(
  alwaysResolve,
  T.map((n) => "The answer is " + n),
);

console.log(response().then((d) => d)); // Output: "The answer is 42"
```

### TaskEither

The `TaskEither` type is a primative that is used to represent a value that may
be computed asynchronously and may be one of two types. It is a very common type
in functional programming and is generally used to replace `Promise` objects
that may throw errors.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/function";
import * as TE from "fp-ts/TaskEither";

const fetchData = (url: string) =>
  TE.tryCatch(
    () => fetch(url).then((res) => res.text()),
    (e) => `Error fetching data, ${String(e)}`,
  );
const parse = (str: string) =>
  TE.tryCatch(
    () => JSON.parse(str),
    (e) => `Error parsing data, ${String(e)}`,
  );
const stringify = (obj: unknown) =>
  TE.tryCatch(
    async () => JSON.stringify(obj),
    (e) => `Error stringify-ing data, ${String(e)}`,
  );

const getJson = pipe(
  fetchData("https://example.com"), // try to fetch data or return error message
  TE.chain(parse), // if successful, parse the data or return error message
  TE.chain(stringify), // if successful, stringify the data or return error message
);

console.log(getJson().then((e) => e)); // Output: Right("{\"foo\":\"bar\"}")
```

## Composition

### pipe vs flow

The `pipe` and `flow` functions are used to compose functions together. They are
very similar, but have a few key differences. The `pipe` function starts with a
value and then applies a series of functions to it. The `flow` function composes
a series of functions together and then returns a new function that can be
applied to a value.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe, flow } from "fp-ts/lib/function";

const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const square = (x: number): number => x ** 2;

const doubleSquarePipe = (input: number) =>
  pipe(
    input,
    double, // apply double function
    square, // apply square function
  );

const doubleSquareFlow = flow(
  double, // apply double function
  square, // apply square function
);
```

### chain

The `chain` function is used to flatten nested primatives. When you need to
flatten left or right values, you can use the `chain` function. It is very
similar to the `flatMap` function in other languages.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import * as TE from "fp-ts/lib/TaskEither";

const maybeUserId: TE.TaskEither<string, number> = TE.right(3);

const parseUser = pipe(
  maybeUserId, // start with a TaskEither<string, number>
  TE.chain((id) =>
    pipe(
      id,
      double, // apply double function
      TE.fromPredicate(
        (n) => n > 0, // check if the value is positive
        () => "ID is not positive",
      ),
      TE.map((id) => ({
        id,
        name: "John Doe",
      })),
    ),
  ),
);

console.log(parseUser()); // Output: Right({ id: 6, name: 'John Doe' })
```

### match or fold

The `match` function is used to extract values from primatives. When you need to
extract a value to be used in the application, `match` forces you to think about
both the left and right values.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import * as O from "fp-ts/lib/Option";

const maybeNumber: O.Option<number> = O.some(3);

const result = pipe(
  maybeNumber, // start with an Option<number>
  O.map(double), // apply double function
  O.map(square), // apply square function
  O.match(
    () => "No number found",
    (n) => "The result is " + n,
  ),
);

console.log(result); // Output: "The result is 36"
```

sometimes its needed to return multiple types from a match. In this case, you
can use the `foldW` function.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import * as O from "fp-ts/lib/Option";

const maybeNumber: O.Option<number> = O.some(3);

const result = pipe(
  maybeNumber, // start with an Option<number>
  O.map(double), // apply double function
  O.map(square), // apply square function
  O.matchW(
    () => ({ status: "error", error: "No number" }), // return an error object
    (n) => ({ status: "ok", data: n }), // return a data object
  ),
);

console.log(result); // Output: { status: 'ok', data: 36 }
```
