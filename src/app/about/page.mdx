# About Me

I'm a Zurich-based **Interaction Engineer**. Data visualisation is a potent tool
for understanding and communicating complex information. As a garden designer, I
aimed to create beautiful, sustainable spaces that enhance the well-being of
people and the planet. Now as a web developer, I want to empower people to
understand the earth bet In my life, I've travelled to many places, met many
people, and pursued varied careers. From a baker in Canada to a bamboo builder
in Costa Rica and from a landscaper in England to a web designer in Switzerland,
I've always been passionate about learning new skills and applying them to
real-world projects.

My approach to problem-solving is rooted in three core principles:

- Passionate about **sustainability** and having a positive impact on the planet
- Obsessed with **systems thinking** and understanding the interconnectedness of
  different disciplines
- Constantly **learning** new skills and applying them to real-world projects

This website is a personal portfolio and experimental space where I can showcase
my projects, experiment with new ideas, and share my thoughts and experiences
through blogging. Please feel free to explore my recent projects, read my
experiments and blog posts, and contact me directly via the form below or
