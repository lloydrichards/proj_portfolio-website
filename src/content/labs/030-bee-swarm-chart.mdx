A bee swarm chart is a type of scatter plot that uses a force simulation to
prevent overlapping points. This is a great way to visualize a large number of
points in a small space. It also allows for single dimension data to be
visualized in a 2D space. By using a force simulation, the points will
automatically move to avoid overlapping each other.

<ResponsiveChart
  className="h-96 rounded bg-muted p-4"
  render={({ width, height }) => (
    <BeeSwarmChart width={width - 32} height={height - 32} data={MockBubbles} />
  )}
/>

The **BeeSwarmChart** above works with the `forceSimulation` from d3. Taking the
data and applying a forces to it, the points will move to avoid overlapping
while clustering around the `timestamp` value. The forces include:

- **forceX**: Moves the points along the x-axis based on the `xScale` and the
  `timestamp` value.
- **forceY**: Moves the points towards the center of the chart.
- **collide**: Prevents overlapping of points by applying a radius to each based
  on the `count` value.

To add some interesting interactions, when you click on a point, it will
highlight all points of that type and apply an additional force to move them
closer to each other while increasing the **forceY** towards the center.

### Interaction GUI

Using [Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva), I created a GUI to control the
forces and the data. This allows you to change the forces and see the
interactions in real time. The GUI can be expanded by clicking the dark grey
panel in the top right and changing the values to update the chart.
