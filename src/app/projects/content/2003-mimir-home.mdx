`mimirHome` is a digital application designed to support the
[mimirOpen](/projects/2002-mimir-open) project. The data collected from the
sensors in the mimirOpen device can be used to answer questions like:

> What kind of house plant should I get?

We can answer this question by understanding where it is going to grow. With a
small home sensor and web app we can take the customer through a series of
features to determine the best plant for their space, first analysing and then
monitoring its success.

While I work with two engineers to bring this idea into a product, my primary
job has been to design and implement the UX/UI for the app; working through
ideation, wire-framing, high fidelity prototypes and data visualization. Data is
processed in Javascript on the back-end via `node.js` and then using `p5.js` to
visualize the data on the front-end.

The app works to allow users to dive deeper and deeper into the data the device
is collecting. On a superficial level they can see a snapshot of their rooms,
spaces and plants. But if they choose then they can click further to explore
each in detail with links back to larger databased of plants, shops, and
analysis.

As an exploration of the data, I prototyped how the data could be visualized
through annotating interesting points in the data. This could be used to show
the user how the environment is changing over time and how the plant is
responding to the environment.

While a line graph is a conventional way of understanding the environmental data
we were collecting, I ultimately wanted to connect this back to the
[mimir](/projects/1901-mimir-visualization) project. I wanted something more
intuitive to show the relationships between days.

The data was downloaded from our server as a JSON object that could be read by a
`p5.js` script I had written. I can quickly update the data to show the reading
in real-time or explore older data to understand the changes experienced by the
space
