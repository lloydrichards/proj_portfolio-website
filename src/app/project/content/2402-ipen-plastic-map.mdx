[Annabelle Vuille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabelle-vuille/) approached me
to develop her vision for the IPEN Plastic Map. The map visualizes the global
distribution of plastic pollution data collected by the
[International Pollutants Elimination Network](https://www.stoppoisonplastic.org/)
(IPEN) and provides an interactive way to explore the data and learn more about
the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

## Project Overview

The IPEN Plastic Map is a web application that visualizes the global
distribution of plastic pollution data collected by the International Pollutants
Elimination Network (IPEN). The map provides an interactive way to explore the
data and learn more about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

The application uses Next.js, Mapbox, and React. In the backend, raw data is
provided and processed from static files into GeoJSONs. The frontend application
consumes the data and renders it on the map. The user interacts with the map by
panning, zooming, and selecting a data point to view more information about the
pollution data.

## Challenges and Insights

One of the main challenges of this project was processing and providing the data
in a format that the frontend application could consume. The raw data, an Excel
file provided by IPEN and collected from project leaders, was parsed and
transformed through a series of scripts to create the static GeoJSON files.

Another challenge was rendering the data on the map in a performant and
user-friendly way. The data comprises hundreds of tabular data points, each
representing a report from IPEN. To make it easier for users to navigate the
reports, I normalized common attributes like countries, partners, and types and
grouped them into dropdown menus that the user could use to filter the data.

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights that will inform our future work:

- The importance of data processing and providing the data in a format that the
  frontend application can consume
- The benefits of using static files to provide the data are that it allows for
  faster loading times and better performance
- The value of user-friendly design and interactivity in data visualization
  projects

## Impact

The IPEN Plastic Map is a valuable resource for partners and the public to
explore the global impact of work on plastic pollution. It is easy to use and
navigate and demonstrates IPEN's impact on plastic pollution worldwide. This
project's success has highlighted the value of visualizing complex data in an
accessible way. It has also provided a valuable resource for IPEN to demonstrate
its impact on plastic pollution.
