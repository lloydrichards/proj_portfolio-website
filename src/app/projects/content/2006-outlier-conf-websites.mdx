In 2020, I joined the events committee to help organize the first Outlier Conf,
a conference for the
[Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.org/). With
the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference was moved online, and I was tasked with
designing and developing the conference website. THe websites became an
important source of information for attendees, speakers, and sponsors. I
continues working and maintaining the websites between 2021 and 2024.

## 2021

In the first year of the conference we were using a Wordpress service provided
by the conference platform. The site was fairly basic but this time provided us
an opportunity to define our brand and graphical styles. With our
[Brand Guidelines](https://workbyoliver.notion.site/Outlier-2021-Brand-Book-68882ee176994e2ab2309a512179da03)
from Oliver Todd I was able to create some atomic ideas for content blocks

![Color Palettes](/images/projects/2006/outlier-conf-web-design-01.png)

From the color palettes I created some atomic ideas for content blocks, defining
five different types of blocks that could be used to create the website. These
blocks had various levels of complexity but were always balanced with accessible
colors and typography.

## 2022

In 2022, we adopted a more flat design. We still used the same color block
elements, but the website was more focused on the content and the speakers
blocks and used less motion.

## 2023

In 2023, we moved the website to SquareSpace and changed to a more dynamic
design with an open 3D space with flat blocks overlaid. The background provided
visual interest while still being able to be turned off for accessibility, and
the blocks were configurable with some CSS injection into SquareSpace.

```css showLineNumbers title="injected.css"
.card-turquoise {
  background-color: #2db1a4;
  color: #231f20;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-width: 4px 8px 8px 4px;
  border-color: #231f20;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}

.card-plum {
  background-color: #9f5f9c;
  color: #f1edea;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-width: 4px 8px 8px 4px;
  border-color: #231f20;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}

.card-mustard {
  background-color: #dcb229;
  color: #231f20;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-width: 4px 8px 8px 4px;
  border-color: #231f20;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}

.card-white {
  background-color: #f1edea;
  color: #231f20;
  padding: 2rem;
  border-width: 4px 8px 8px 4px;
  border-color: #231f20;
  border-style: solid;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```

Using these classes it was possible to style the text blocks in the website,
even through SquareSpace's editor isn't the most flexible.

## 2024

In 2024, there wasn't a lot of redesign as the website was already working well.
We did at this time add a micro-frontend to the website to allow for the agenda
of the conference to be embedded directly into the SquareSpace website.
