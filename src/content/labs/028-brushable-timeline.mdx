import { Timeline } from "../../lab_modules/028";
import { ResponsiveChart } from "../../components/chart/utils/ResponsiveChart.tsx";

There are some things that are more tedious to do with D3 than others. Brushable
timelines are one of them. In this lab, going to explore how to create a
brushable timeline with [Visx](https://airbnb.io/visx). Visx is basiclly a low
lever wrapper for D3 and accepts a lot of the same data structure such as
scales. This makes sprinckling in a few of the more annpying parts such as Axis
and Brushes more flexible.

<ResponsiveChart
  className="bg-muted h-96 rounded p-4"
  render={({ width, height }) => (
    <Timeline width={width - 32} height={height - 32} />
  )}
/>

What I wanted to do was create a brush which I could use to return back the
domain of the scale so I can use it to select or filter data. In this first
example I made a quick timetable which can be brushed to highlight any
intersecting boxes.

```tsx
<Brush
  xScale={xScale}
  yScale={yScale}
  height={height}
  width={width}
  onChange={(domain: Bounds | null) => {
    if (!domain) return;
    setSelected([new Date(domain.x0), new Date(domain.x1)]);
  }}
  onClick={() => setSelected(undefined)}
  //   innerRef={brushRef}
  //   useWindowMoveEvents
  //   resizeTriggerAreas={["left", "right"]}
  //   brushDirection="horizontal"
/>
```

The `Brush` from Visx was quite easy to drop in, taking the same `xScale` and
`yScale` I built using D3. There is an onChange that returns the `Bound` that
can be destructured into the domain values of the scales. There are also several
default values for the `resizeTriggerAreas` and `brushDirection` which can be
used to change the direction of the brush, but the default worked for my use
case.

Using the value returned from the brush it was then possible to change the fill
of the boxes that intersected the brush.

```tsx {1-2, 18-22}
const intersect = (a: [Date, Date], b: [Date, Date]) =>
  a[0] <= b[1] && b[0] <= a[1];

export const Timeline = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <svg>
      {/* ... */}
      {channels.map((c, i) => (
        <rect
          key={`rect-${i}`}
          rx={4}
          x={xScale(c.start)}
          y={yScale(c.channel) || 0}
          width={clampZero(xScale(c.end) - xScale(c.start))}
          height={yScale.bandwidth()}
          fill={
            selected != undefined
              ? intersect(selected, [c.start, c.end])
                ? "tomato"
                : "SteelBlue"
              : "SeaGreen"
          }
        />
      ))}
    </svg>
  );
};
```

### Margin Bug

I noticed while looking at the example that there is a bug with the current
version where the margin on the `<Brush />` doesnt actually do anything. I've
reported this [issue](https://github.com/airbnb/visx/issues/1711) to
airbnb/visx, but for the time being its needed to change the D3 Pattern to match
the translated `<g />` similar to how is done in the `<ChartArea />` of Visx.
