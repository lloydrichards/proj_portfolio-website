Early in the development of a side project that would eventually turn into
[mimirOpen](/projects/2002-mimir-open) was an idea to create data visualizations
that help bridge the understanding between environmental data and the user. The
data was collected from a rudimentary IoT device that was placed in a room to
monitor the environment. Collecting temperature, humidity and light levels, the
device built a dataset that could be used to understand the environment over
time.

The visualizations were created using `p5.js` to create a heatmap of the data
over time. This was done using the sensor data to encode indoor temperature
levels though colour and date-time to x and y position in the grid. Later, I
added the stoke outlines and iconography to connect indoor and outdoor
environments to see what correlations could be made.

The final visualization was a digital mockup of a realtime application that
showed the current and daily trend in a line chart at the bottom that slowly
built up the heatmap above. This was a way to show the user how the environment
was changing over time and how the plant was responding to the environment.
