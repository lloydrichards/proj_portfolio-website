One particularly fun project I got to work on during my time with Interactive
Things was designing a farewell card for one of the partners that was moving to
New York City. Given full control over the project, I quickly brainstormed
various datasets and ideas for connecting Zurich with NYC. After a few attempts
I settles on a scale representation of the city alongside the tallest mountains
in the Appalachian Mountains in comparision to some of the most famous Swiss
mountains.

Thankfully the whole thing fit onto a A5 card and I was able to add some nice
details like the individual heights as well as the respective tree line for each
mountain range.

_Below you will find a few of the other versions that I came up with as I
refined the design._
