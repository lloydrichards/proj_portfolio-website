## Hive Connector App

As part of the Vatorex hive monitoring system, the Hive Connector App is used to
connect to the Vatorex products via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The app provides
a user interface to configure the Vatorex products and to download the data from
the products to the smartphone. The app is available for Android and iOS.

The app is developed using the Flutter framework, which allows to develop for
both Android and iOS with a single code base. The app is also integrated with
Firebase for authentication and data storage.
