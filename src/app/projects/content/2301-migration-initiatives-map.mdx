The Migration Initiatives Map is an interactive map that showcases the projects
and initiatives in the field of migration in Niger. The map is a tool for the
[International Organization for Migration](https://niger.iom.int/) (IOM) to
visualize and communicate the work they are doing in the region. The map is
designed to be used by IOM staff, partners, and the public to explore the
projects and initiatives in the region.

Built with `NextJS` and `MapLibre`, the map is a fully responsive web
application that works on all devices. The map is available in English and
French and is designed to be easy to use and navigate. The map is also
integrated with the IOM's content management system, allowing the IOM to easily
update and manage the content on the map.

Working with a CMS for the dataset of projects and initiatives, we were able to
show the geographical distribution of the projects and initiatives in the
region. Using metadata we could then aggregate and filter the projects backed on
the control panel as well as focus in on specific projects to get more
information.

The collaboration was important to ensure that the map met the needs of the IOM
and their partners while still being easy to use and navigate for the public.
Working closely with stakeholders ensured we were able both the UX and stability
needed for a public-facing project.
