P5.js is actually where I started with coding and data visualization and a lot
of love goes out to [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net/) and his channel
[The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) where I learnt most of my
initial understanding of Javascript, APIs, even Firebase.

Its been a while since I last used P5.js and since then have moved much more
into React and Typescript so will need to see how the two play with each other.
If this is successful then I'll start to have a look at some simple algorithms
and build some fun little programs with P5.js and then try implement them in
D3.js as well.

## Basic Setup

That took a lot of tweaking and swearing, but I got it working. It seemed there
is a problem with implementing the p5 instance when using either `useEffect()`
on a functional component or `componentDidMount()` on a class component. In the
end it turned out I had to require the p5 library inside the componentDiDMount
which kind of screwed up the type for it and set it to any, but did let it
render. Not sure if this is a good solution, but at least I can now make things.

Something I quite like about this thought is that I can now break up the
sketches into separate files and import them as needed. This I think will be
super useful for experimenting and forking different sketches and seeing how
they might work in various areas of a site.
