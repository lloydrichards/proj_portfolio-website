Part of the frustration when building out an interactive or reactive chart is having to
tweak parameters and re-run the code to see the results. This is especially true when
working with physics simulations, where the results are often unpredictable and
non-deterministic. I've been experimenting with using [Leva](https://github.com/pmndrs/leva)
as a GUI for tweaking parameters and seeing the results in real-time. This is a
proof-of-concept for using Leva to tweak the parameters of a physics simulation.

<OptimizedNestedBubblePacking data={MockBubbles} />

## How it works

In the `OptimizedNestedBubblePacking` component, I'm using the `useControls` hook from
Leva to create a GUI for tweaking the parameters of the physics simulation. The
`useControls` hook returns an object with the values of the controls, which I'm passing
into the `useEffect` hook as dependencies. This means that whenever the values of the
controls change, the `useEffect` hook will run again, and the physics simulation will
re-run with the new parameters.

```jsx
const { alpha } = useControls({
  alpha: {
    value: 0.8,
    min: 0,
    max: 1,
  },
});
```

I can then play around with the parameters and see the results in real-time. This is
especially useful when working with simulation parameters such as alpha, which controls
the strength of the force that pulls the bubbles towards the center of the chart. I can
also tweak the parameters of the physics simulation while the simulation is running, and
see the results in real-time.

## Collaborating with Designers

I think this approach could be useful for collaborating with designers. Designers can
play around with the parameters of the physics simulation and see the results in
real-time. They can then tweak the parameters until they get the desired result, and
share the parameters with the me. This is already something that I do with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/),
where I create a Storybook for each component, and designers can play around with the
props of the component and see the results in real-time. But _Leva_ is more suited for
tweaking the parameters of a physics simulation, and it's easier to set up than
Storybook.
