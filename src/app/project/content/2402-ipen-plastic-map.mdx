I was approached by
[Annabelle Vuille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabelle-vuille/) to develop her
vision for the IPEN Plastic Map. The map visualizes the global distribution of
plastic pollution data collected by the International Pollutants Elimination
Network (IPEN). The map provides an interactive way to explore the data and
learn more about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

## Project Overview

The IPEN Plastic Map is a web application that visualizes the global
distribution of plastic pollution data collected by the International Pollutants
Elimination Network (IPEN). The map provides an interactive way to explore the
data and learn more about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

The map is built using Next.js, Mapbox, and React. The data is processed and
provided through static files which were processed into GeoJSON format. The
frontend application consumes the data and renders it on the map. The user can
interact with the map by panning and zooming, and by selecting a data point to
view more information about the pollution data.

## Challenges and Insights

One of the main challenges of this project was processing and providing the data
in a format that could be consumed by the frontend application. The data was
provided in excel file, which needed to be processed into GeoJSON format. This
required writing a script to parse the excel file and convert it into GeoJSON
format.

Another challenge was rendering the data on the map in a way that was performant
and user-friendly. The data consisted of hundreds of data points, with many
unique attributes. To address this, we parsed and grouped the unique attributes
and displayed them the filter panel. This allowed the user to filter the data
points based on the attributes, making it easier to explore the data.

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights that will inform our future work:

- The importance of data processing and providing the data in a format that can
  be consumed by the frontend application
- The benefits of using static files to provide the data, as it allows for
  faster loading times and better performance
- The value of user-friendly design and interactivity in data visualization
  projects

## Impact

The IPEN Plastic Map provides a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers,
and the public to explore the global distribution of plastic pollution data. The
map is designed to be easy to use and navigate, and provides a powerful tool for
understanding the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

The success of this project has highlighted the value of visualizing complex
data in an accessible way, and has provided a valuable resource for those
working to address the issue of plastic pollution.
