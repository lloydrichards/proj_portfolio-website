import { SimpleTimelineChart, mockOccupations } from "./031.tsx";

The first step in refactoring the Timeline from my old CV was to create a simple
version of the chart. To move over the logic for how the offsetting works and
how to draw the lines, its easier to start with a simple version of the chart.

### Simple Timeline

    <SimpleTimelineChart width={500} data={mockOccupations} />


It was quite easy to get the helper functions for `lookupInRange()` and using it
to map over the data to add the channel property. This can be used with a
`xScale()` to get the x position of the line.

More tricky was the line which is drawn using a `path` element. I had to
remember how to use the `d3.line()` function created a `lineConnector()` which
accepts two points and draws a stepped curve between them.

```tsx
const lineConnector = line()
  .curve(curveStep)
  .x((d) => d[0])
  .y((d) => d[1]);

<path
  d={
    lineConnector([
      [xScale(d.channel) + 48, y1 - height / 2],
      [textMargin, idx * textBlockHeight + textBlockHeight / 2],
    ]) || ""
  }
  stroke={cScale(d.category) || "black"}
  fill="none"
  strokeWidth={2}
/>;
```

Next step will be to add some interaction and animation to the chart. I want to
be able to hover over the lines and have the text block highlight. I also want
to be able to filter and organize the data by category.
