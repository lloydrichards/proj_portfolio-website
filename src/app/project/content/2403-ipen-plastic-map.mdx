[Annabelle Vuille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabelle-vuille/) approached me
to develop her vision for the IPEN Plastic Map. The map visualizes the global
distribution of plastic pollution data collected by the
[International Pollutants Elimination Network](https://www.stoppoisonplastic.org/)
(IPEN) and provides an interactive way to explore the data and learn more about
the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

## Project Overview

The IPEN Plastic Map is a web application that visualizes the global
distribution of plastic pollution data collected by the International Pollutants
Elimination Network (IPEN). The map provides an interactive way to explore the
data and learn more about the impact of plastic pollution on the environment.

The application uses `Next.js`, `Mapbox`, and `React`. In the backend, raw data
is provided and processed from static files into GeoJSONs. The frontend
application consumes the data and renders it on the map. The user interacts with
the map by panning, zooming, and selecting a data point to view more information
about the pollution data.

## Challenges and Insights

One of the main challenges of this project was processing and providing the data
in a format that the frontend application could consume. The raw data, an Excel
file provided by IPEN and collected from project leaders, was difficult to
normalize and included a lot of rich text. To create consistent data, I created
a pipeline to parse and transform the data through a series of scripts and
create static GeoJSON files.

Another challenge was rendering the data on the map in a performant and
user-friendly way. The data comprises hundreds of tabular data points, each
could represent multiple data points on the map. By normalizing string values in
the raw data like countries, partners, and type, it was easier for users to
navigate the reports through dropdown menus that the user could use to filter
the data.

Also, because of the data pipeline, it was possible to aggregate the GeoJSON
into regional data points, which allowed new views of the data while keeping the
map performant without the need for client-side aggregation. The country data
was around 100kb, while the regional data only 5kb, which made the map load
faster and more responsive.

## Key Learnings

This project provided great insights that I will carry forward in my future
work:

- Creating a pipeline to process and transform raw data into a domain-specific
  format made it easier for the frontend application to consume the data
- Static files created in the build process allows for faster loading times and
  better performance
- Normalizing values like countries was very important when mapping to
  geo-spacial data and creating aggregations

## Impact

The IPEN Plastic Map is a valuable resource for partners and the public to
explore the global impact of work on plastic pollution. Despite the small budget
and tight timeline, the project was a success and the map is now live and
available for use. IPEN can now use the map to communicate the impact of their
work to a wider audience and raise awareness about the importance of reducing
plastic pollution.
