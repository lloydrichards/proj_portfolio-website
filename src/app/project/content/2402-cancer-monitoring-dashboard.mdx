In collaboration with the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS) I worked on the
team developing the Cancer Monitoring Dashboard which visualises statistical
data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. This project showcases our
expertise in creating user-friendly data visualisation tools while addressing
unique challenges in public health communication.

## Project Overview

The dashboard consisted of three main pages with around eight chart types
showing statistical information about cancer incidence, deaths, and survival
rates. The data was provided by the BFS and visualised in a way that was easy
for the general public to understand.

The development team split responsibilities across three main areas: Line
Charts, Table Charts, and Layout + Theming. My role was to tackle the Table
Charts, consisting of Butterfly, Lollipop, Population Pyramids, Arrow and
BoxPlot charts. To make them accessible and easy to navigate, my strategy was a
combination of semantic HTML tables and SVG built using D3.js, where each row of
the table was a separate SVG element, allowing for a flexible template for each
chart type.

Another significant achievement was expanding our `swiss-federal-ci` library,
which is now a shared component library across multiple projects. This effort to
standardise the UI components helps us work quickly and effectively to bring the
design to life.

## Challenges and Insights

Throughout the project, we encountered and overcame several challenges:

- Managing complex data representations, including the distinction between zero
  values and non-existent data
- Implementing sophisticated visual elements while maintaining accessibility
- Ensuring absolute data accuracy is critical, given the sensitive nature of
  health statistics

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights that will inform our future work:

- The importance of clear technical boundaries when working with non-technical
  clients
- The benefits of being flexible with initial project specifications when it
  serves the end product
- The value of thorough planning and coordination between developers for
  efficiency.

## Impact

The success of the Cancer Monitoring Dashboard is a practical step in making
public health data more accessible and understandable. It serves as a tool for
healthcare professionals and the public while maintaining the highest data
accuracy standards and user accessibility expected from the BFS.
