As part of my work with [Vatorex](https://www.vatorex.ch/), I developed an app
for beekeepers to help them manage and track their bees. The app is available on
the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

The app allows beekeepers to track the health of their hives, record
inspections, and track the development of their bees. It also provides a
platform for beekeepers to explore the data provided by the Full Hive Kits, an
IoT device developed by Vatorex.

The app is built using the Flutter framework, which allows for a single codebase
to be used for both Android and iOS. The app is also integrated with Firebase
for authentication and data storage.
