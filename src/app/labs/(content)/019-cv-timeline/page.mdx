The plan here is to build a system in which a timeline of past education and
experience. There are several pieces here that I'd like to include in this
diagram including linking blurbs and their place on the timeline, as well as
tooltips for included skills.

First step is to setup D3.js with a timeline and a simple input for data and
squares. Lets have a go at the new(er) `.join()` pattern in React.

## Adding Elements

<BasicTimeline />

Okay, so thats a working D3 example. With this, the data is being managed by
React and `useState()` and then using`useEffect()`  
D3 can take over the manipulation of the SVGs inside its box. While I'm sure D3
could build the whole timeline I'm thinking off, what I think is better is if
the text blurbs are generated as a list beside the timeline and then using D3,
build the timeline and draw lines that connect to the appropriate list item.

## Timeline Components

<CVTimeline />

This feels really good. I've built a `TimeLine.tsx` component that can take in
props for the data, including occupations and events which it then renders into
this horizontal timeline. The graph scales to the size of the data and even
orders the boxes and colours them according to their overlap and props. So cool
to see this come together so nicely!

The timeline here is build with some dummy data which is being managed in the
parent component which should allow me to edit and tweak the data on the go as
well as filter it. Lets have a go

## Add Elements with Form

That kind of works. There seems to be an issue with the different layers of
boxes not being removed when changing layers, but i'm not really sure what to do
about this.

The question now is: Do I render the whole chart in one go, including the text
on the side? Or should this be a separate component that lists the items and
then I can figure out how to draw a line between them?
