## Getting Started

This is a test post to see how MDX and `contentlayer` work together. I'm hoping
to rebuild my website with this stack.

### Importing TSX Components

import { LineChart } from "@/components/chart/line_chart/LineChart";
import { mockLineChartProps } from "./mock-data";

<LineChart data={mockLineChartProps.base.data} />

This is a line chart that I wrote in TSX. It's a bit of a pain to import it into
MDX, but it's possible.

### Importing Story

> Attempted to import the `Meta` and `Canvas` components from a storybook story.
> This didn't work. I think it's because the storybook is also a MDX compiler
> and `contentlayer` doesn't like that.
