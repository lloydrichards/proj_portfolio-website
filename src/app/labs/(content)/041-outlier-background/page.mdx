While I was building the [Outlier conf app](/projects/2100-outlier-conf-app), I
wanted to create a 3D background for the website that would be visually
interesting and inline with the conference's branding of thinking outside the
box. I decided to use Three.js to create a simple 3D background that would be
rendered in the browser.

<canvas
  suppressHydrationWarning
  className="my-6 h-160 w-full overflow-clip rounded-2xl border-4"
  id="bg"
></canvas>
> If you can't see the 3D background, please refresh the page.

The challenge I had was that the website was build using SquareSpace, which
isn't the most developer-friendly platform. I had to find a way to inject the
Three.js code into the website without breaking the existing layout and still
being able to use the SquareSpace editor to make changes.

I decided to create a simple script that would inject the Three.js code into the
website. The script would create a canvas element and render the 3D background
in the browser. I then added the script to the website using the SquareSpace
embedded script feature.

## Parallax Effect

The code for the 3D background is quite simple. I created a new Three.js scene
and added a few 3D objects to it. I then created a simple animation loop that
would rotate the objects in the scene. The code is shown below:

```js showLineNumbers
// Render Loop
const render = function () {
  requestAnimationFrame(render);
  if (!outlier) return;
  const t = document.body.getBoundingClientRect().top;
  outlier.rotation.x += 0.01;
  outlier.rotation.y += 0.01;
  outlier.position.y = t * 0.005;

  outlierLight.position.y = t * 0.005;

  // rotates stars
  stars.forEach((star: { rotation: { x: number; y: number } }) => {
    star.rotation.x += 0.005;
    star.rotation.y += 0.005;
  });

  camera.position.y = t * +0.01;

  // Render the scene
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
};
```

At the same time I attach the y position of the `outlier`, `camera.position` and
`outlierLight` to the scroll position of the page. This creates a parallax
effect where the 3D objects move in response to the user scrolling the page.
