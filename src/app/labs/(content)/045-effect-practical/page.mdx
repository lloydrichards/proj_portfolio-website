Continuing with the theme of looking back on what I learnt with
[fp-ts: The Practical (Part 2)](/labs/033-fp-ts-practical) I want to look at
some practical examples with `Effect`. With `fp-ts` I've found certain patterns
to be useful when tackling common problems and want to see how they translate to
`Effect`.

At the same time, I've been doing some remodeling of my website by introducing
some of these patterns here too. Where possible I'll try to provide examples and
links to the changes I've made in a working application.

### Manipulating Arrays

Add the data level is always important to know how to manipulation can be
cleanly represented. With `Effect` I've found that the `Array` be an essential
api to understand.

```ts showLineNumbers {5-12} {15-19} title="get-all-projects.ts"
export const getAllProjects = pipe(
  FileSystem.FileSystem,
  Effect.andThen((fs) => fs.readDirectory(PROJECT_PATH)),
  Effect.andThen((filenames) =>
    Effect.all(
      pipe(
        filenames,
        Array.map((f) => f.replace(/\.mdx$/, "")),
        Array.map(getProject)
      ),
      { concurrency: "unbounded" }
    )
  ),
  Effect.map(
    flow(
      Array.map(([_, p]) => p),
      Array.sortBy(Order.mapInput(Order.number, (d) => d.id)),
      Array.reverse
    )
  )
);
```

In this function, I'm reading a directory of files, then mapping over the
filenames to get the project data. The first highlighted section for the
`Effect.all` shows how `Array.map` can be used to clean up the data before
passing it to the `getProject` function. The second highlighted section shows
how to sort and reverse the data using the `Array` api.

In particular I'm a huge fan on the `Order.mapInput` function as it allows for
careful selection of properties to sort by and can be combined with multiple
operations to create integrate sorting logic.

```ts
type Lab = {
  readonly title: string;
  readonly date: string;
};

const byYear = Order.mapInput(Order.number, (lab: Lab) =>
  new Date(lab.date).getFullYear()
);
const byName = Order.mapInput(Order.string, (lab: Lab) => lab.title);

const labOrd = Order.combine(byYear, byName); // Sort first by year, then by name
```

### Result Type

Something that I found very useful in `fp-ts` was the `Either` type. Such a
powerful way to represent success and failure of a non synchronous operation. In
`Effect` the same can be achieved with the `Effect` type, but with the added
benefit off being able to collect multiple errors throughout the operations.

```ts showLineNumbers {8-12} {14} title="get-lab.ts"
class ImportError extends Data.TaggedError("ImportError")<{
  path: string;
}> {}

//             ┏━━ Effect.Effect<Lab, ImportError | ParseError, never>
export const getLab = (slug: string) =>
  pipe(
    Effect.tryPromise({
      try: () => import(`@/app/labs/(content)/${slug}/page.mdx`),
      catch: () =>
        new ImportError({ path: `@/app/labs/(content)/${slug}/page.mdx` }), // fail with ImportError
    }),
    Effect.map((d) => d.metadata),
    Effect.andThen(Schema.decodeUnknown(LabMeta)), // might fail with ParseError
    Effect.andThen((metadata) => ({
      ...metadata,
      pathname: `/labs/${slug}`,
      slug,
      lastModified: new Date(),
      ogImageURL: makeOGImageURL({
        title: metadata.title,
        description: metadata.description,
        tags: [...metadata.tags],
        date: metadata.date,
      }),
      isPublished: metadata.isPublished ?? true,
    }))
  );
```

Firs thing I noticed when implementing this pattern was using a class to define
the errors. This was rather shocking for a functional programming pattern, but
I'm getting use to them. In the function there are two places that might fail
with the `Effect.tryPromise` and the `Schema.decodeUnknown`. The first has a
defined `ImportError` and the second has a `ParseError` from Schema.

Without any type casting, the `Effect` type is able to infer the error types and
bubble them up into the return type of the functions.

```ts /Lab/#success /ImportError/#destructive /ParseError/#destructive
//                           ┌────────────────────────────────── on Success
//                           │        ┌─────────────┬─────────── on Failure
type Return = Effect.Effect<Lab, ImportError | ParseError, never>;
```

### Graceful Error Handling

What makes this so powerful is then being able to chose how to deal with these
failures later in the program as needed. This makes functions very composable
and flexible in that they can be combined in multiple ways and the resulting
errors can either be handled or bubbled further up.

```ts showLineNumbers {10} title="api/index.ts"
const ApiRuntime = ManagedRuntime.make(Layer.mergeAll(BunContext.layer));

export const api = {
  labs: {},
  projects: {
    fetchAllProjects: async () => ApiRuntime.runPromise(getAllProjects),
    fetchFeaturedProjects: async () =>
      ApiRuntime.runPromise(getFeaturedProjects),
    queryProjectBySlug: async (slug: string) =>
      ApiRuntime.runPromise(getProject(slug).pipe(Effect.either)),
    getProjectBySlug: async (slug: string) =>
      ApiRuntime.runPromise(getProject(slug)),
  },
  occupations: {},
  skills: {},
} as const;
```

At the edge of my application logic where I need to pass this information to the
presentation layer (React), I get to make the choice what to do with the
failures. Since I'm using `Effect.runPromise`, anything that fails will throw a
rejected promise that can be caught and handled by `Suspense` or crash the
application.

Sometimes I want to handle the errors explicitly, in which case I can use the
`Effect.either` function to return a `Either` type that can be pattern matched
on in the presentation layer.

```tsx showLineNumbers {9-14} title="projects/[slug]/page.tsx"
const ProjectPage = async ({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}) => {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const result = await api.projects.queryProjectBySlug(slug);

  if (Either.isLeft(result)) {
    if (result.left._tag == "MissingContentError") {
      return notFound();
    }
    throw new Error(result.left._tag);
  }

  const [content, project] = result.right;

  const team = await getTeamMembers(project.team);

  return (
    <>
      <ProjectInfoCard project={project} team={team} />
      <article className="col-span-full mt-8 mb-16">{content}</article>
    </>
  );
};
```

This means that for other places like the `generateStaticParams` function that
is used in the build process, I expect this to throw an error if something goes
wrong. In this way I can simplify my code and just let the error bubble up into
the promise and let the build fail.

```ts
const generateStaticParams = async () => {
  const allProjects = await api.projects.fetchAllProjects();
  const paths = allProjects.map(({ slug }) => ({
    slug: encodeURI(slug),
  }));
  return paths;
};
```

## Conclusion

I'm really enjoying the patterns that I've been able to implement with `Effect`
so far. The code is cleaner and easier to reason about and makes for changes to
be made with confidence. Recently I've been playing around with the sorting
order of the projects and labs and have been able to make changes with ease.

I also realize that my api boundary between the presentation layer and the
application layer is a big of an anti-pattern when it comes to `Effect` but in
this way I can keep the impact of `Effect` contained and use some of the error
handling patterns of React to deal with the failures too. Maybe this is what the
next part should be about.
