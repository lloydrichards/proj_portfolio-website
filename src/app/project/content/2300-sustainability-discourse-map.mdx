The Sustainability Discourse Map is a data visualization of critical aspects of
the current and past discourse around urban sustainability in Z端rich. The map is
based on a dataset of 1,000 articles from the Tages Anzeiger newspaper, and it
is designed to help researchers, policymakers, and the public understand the
evolution of the discourse around sustainability in Z端rich.

The map was built using `Next.js`, `D3.js`, and `React`. The data was processed
and provided through a REST API, that was consumed by the frontend
application.  
Using `D3.js`, the data points were grouped and simulated into a force-directed
graph, which was then rendered in the browser. The user can interact with the
graph by panning and filtering the data points. The user can also select a data
point to view the article's content and metadata.
