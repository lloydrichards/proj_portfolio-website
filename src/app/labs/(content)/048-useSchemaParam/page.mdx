I had a thought the other day about how to validate query parameters in a React
application for state management. I remember hearing once that the reason React
developers are no dependent on `useState` is because ReactRouter was no terrible
at managing state in the URL.

Recently I've been working with Effect Schema and I thought it would be
interesting to create a hook that would validate query parameters using
Effect.Schema. This would allow us to ensure that the query parameters are valid
and conform to a specific schema, which can help prevent bugs and improve the
overall reliability of our application.

import { SchemaCounter } from "./SchemaCounter";
import { Suspense } from "react";

<div className="py-8">
  <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading...</p>}>
    <SchemaCounter />
  </Suspense>
</div>

## Something simple to validate

I build a simple little app using NextJS
([repo](https://github.com/lloydrichards/edu_next-schema-params)) to demonstrate
this idea. The app allows you to increment and decrement a counter using a few
different methods. The simplest was using `useState`:

import { SimpleCounter } from "./SimpleCounter";

<div className="py-8">
  <SimpleCounter />
</div>

I also build one that leverages the `useSearchParams` hook from
`next/navigation` to manage the state of the counter in the URL. This allows us
to "save" the state of the counter in the URL, so that if we refresh the page,
the counter will still be at the same value.

The final version of the app uses Effect Schema to validate the query parameters
and ensure that they conform to a specific schema. This allows us to catch any
errors in the query parameters before they cause issues in the application. The
schema is defined using Effect Schema, which provides a powerful and flexible
way to define schemas for data validation.

You can test the `Schema Counter Component` above by clicking around but you
should also try the following:

1. `Increment` and `decrement` the counter using the buttons.
1. Toggling the `Factor` and seeing the path changes
1. Manually changing the query parameters in the URL to invalid values (e.g.
   `?a=abc`) and seeing how the component handles it.
1. Refresh the page and see how the counter retains its value from the URL.

## The `useSchemaParam` hook

Thanks to some fancy generics, it was possible to create a hook that would
accept a Struct or Record Schema and return the current state from the URL, as
well as a function to build a new query string based on the current state and
any updates.

```ts showLineNumbers title="@/hooks/use-schema-params.ts"
export function useSchemaParams<A extends Record<string, unknown>, I>(
  schema: Schema.Schema<A, I, never>,
  defaultValue: A
) {
  const params = useSearchParams();

  const paramResult = Schema.decodeUnknownEither(Schema.partial(schema))(
    groupParamsByKey(params)
  );

  const buildQueryString = useCallback(
    (partialParams: Partial<A>) => {
      const newParams = new URLSearchParams(params.toString());

      const encoded = Schema.encodeUnknownSync(Schema.partial(schema))({
        ...paramResult.pipe(
          Either.match({
            onLeft: () => ({} as Record<string, unknown>),
            onRight: (p) => p,
          })
        ),
        ...partialParams,
      });

      if (encoded && typeof encoded === "object") {
        Object.entries(encoded).forEach(([key, value]) => {
          if (value !== undefined) {
            newParams.set(key, String(value));
          }
        });
      }

      return newParams.toString();
    },
    [paramResult, schema, params]
  );

  return [
    Either.getOrElse(paramResult, () => defaultValue),
    buildQueryString,
  ] as const;
}
```

In usage, it feels quite similar to using `useState` where it accepts Schema and
a default value:

```ts {7-9}
const ParamSchema = Schema.Struct({
  foo: Schema.String,
});

export const SchemaCounter = () => {
  const [data, createQueryString] = useSchemaParams(ParamSchema, {
    foo: "default",
  });

  return <p>{data.foo}</p>;
};
```

I've tried to keep any exceptions to a minimum, so if the query parameters are
invalid, it will return the default value instead of throwing an error. This
allows the application to continue functioning even if the query parameters are
invalid.

## Testing the components

Something that was really useful for building this was using `vitest`,
`@testing-library/react`, and `next-router-mock` to test the components. I was
able to mock the router and define the query parameters to test the components
in isolation.

```ts showLineNumbers {7-9, 16-24} title="@/__tests__/SchemaCounter.test.tsx"
import { cleanup, render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import { afterEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from "vitest";
import { SchemaCounter } from "./SchemaCounter";
import { MemoryRouterProvider } from "next-router-mock/MemoryRouterProvider";
import mockRouter from "next-router-mock";

vi.mock("next/navigation", () =>
  vi.importActual("next-router-mock/navigation")
);

describe("SchemaCounter", () => {
  afterEach(() => {
    mockRouter.reset();
  });

  it("handles non-numeric values gracefully", () => {
    mockRouter.push("/?a=abc");
    render(<SchemaCounter />, {
      wrapper: MemoryRouterProvider,
    });
    expect(screen.getByTestId("count").textContent).toBe("0");
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByLabelText("Increment"));
    expect(mockRouter.query.a).toBe("1");
  });
});
```

This allowed for a TDD approach to building the components and ensuring that
they worked as expected and defining the API upfront.

## Conclusion

This was a fun little experiment to see how we could use Effect Schema to
validate query parameters in a React application. It allowed us to create a hook
that could be used to validate query parameters and ensure that they conform to
a specific schema. This can help prevent bugs and improve the overall
reliability of our application. It also allowed us to test the components in
isolation and ensure that they worked as expected.
