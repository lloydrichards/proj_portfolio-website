## The Practical

I find many of the tutorials on fp-ts to be a bit too low level. They are great
for learning the fundamentals, but I wanted to see some more practical examples.
I've been using fp-ts in production for a while now, and I wanted to explore
some commone use cases that I've encountered.

Before jumping into the examples, I want to mention another library that I found
to be very useful. [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) is a library for
runtime type checking. It is a great companion to fp-ts, and I will be using it
in some of the examples below.

### DeepEqual of Nested Objects

Sometimes you need to compare two objects to see if they are equal. This is
pretty easy to do with primitive values, but it gets a bit more complicated when
you have nested objects. You can use `JSON.stringify` to compare the objects,
but this is not very efficient. It is also not very flexible, since it will
compare all of the properties on the object. What if you only want to compare
some of the properties?

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as t from "io-ts";
import * as EQ from "io-ts/Eq";

const Filter = t.type({
  types: t.array(t.string),
  range: t.tuple([t.number, t.number]),
  boolean: t.boolean,
  user: t.type({
    name: t.string,
    id: t.number,
  }),
});
type Filter = t.TypeOf<typeof Filter>;

const FilterEq = EQ.struct<Filter>({
  types: EQ.array(EQ.string),
  range: EQ.tuple(EQ.number, EQ.number),
  boolean: EQ.boolean,
  user: EQ.struct({
    name: EQ.string,
    id: EQ.number,
  }),
});

const isEqual = (a: Filter, b: Filter) => FilterEq.equals(a, b);

const settings: Filter = {
  types: ["a", "b"],
  range: [1, 2],
  boolean: true,
  user: {
    name: "John",
    id: 1,
  },
};

console.log(isEqual(settings, settings)); // Output: true
console.log(isEqual(settings, { ...settings, user: { name: "Fred", id: 2 } })); // Output: false
```

### Elegant IO Layer (Error Handling)

This is borrowed heavily from
[fp-ts and Even More Beautiful API Calls (w/ sum types!)](https://dev.to/anthonyjoeseph/fp-ts-and-even-more-beautiful-api-calls-w-sum-types-53j0)
but also expands on it a bit. This pattern is great for handeling APIs that are
less trustworthy. It allows you to handle errors in a very elegant way, without
having to crash the application.

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as A from "fp-ts/lib/Array";
import * as O from "fp-ts/lib/Option";
import * as T from "fp-ts/Task";
import * as TE from "fp-ts/TaskEither";
import * as t from "io-ts";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";
import { failure } from "io-ts/PathReporter";

const ApiData = t.type({
  status: t.string,
  value: t.type({
    id: t.number,
    name: t.string,
  }),
});
type ApiData = t.TypeOf<typeof ApiData>;

interface NetworkError {
  type: "NetworkError";
  message: string;
}
interface ParseError {
  type: "ParseError";
  errors: t.Errors;
}
type AppError = NetworkError | ParseError;

const handleErrors = (appError: AppError): T.Task<string> => {
  switch (appError.type) {
    case "NetworkError":
      return T.of(`Network error: ${appError.message}`);
    case "ParseError":
      return pipe(
        appError.errors,
        failure,
        A.head,
        O.getOrElse(() => "Unknown error"),
        T.of,
      );
  }
};

const getFromUrl = (url: string) =>
  pipe(
    TE.tryCatch(
      () => fetch(url),
      (e) => ({ type: "NetworkError", message: String(e) }),
    ),
    TE.chain((x) => TE.of(x.json())),
    TE.mapLeft(({ message }): AppError => ({ type: "NetworkError", message })),
    TE.chain((json) =>
      pipe(
        ApiData.decode(json),
        E.mapLeft((errors): AppError => ({ type: "ParseError", errors })),
        TE.fromEither,
      ),
    ),
    TE.fold(handleErrors, (data) => T.of(data.value.name)),
  );

getFromUrl("https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random")().then(console.log); // Output: "Invalid value undefined supplied to : { status: string, value: { id: number, name: string } }/status: string"
```

### Branching Render Logic

This pattern is very useful in React applications. It allows you to branch your
render logic based on the type of data that you have. This is very useful when
you have a loading or error state that you want to handle differently.

```ts showLineNumbers
import * as E from "fp-ts/lib/Either";
import * as IO from "fp-ts/lib/IO";
import * as O from "fp-ts/lib/Option";
import { pipe } from "fp-ts/lib/function";

export const ConditionalRender: FC<{ value?: number }> = ({ value }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    return pipe(
      value,
      O.fromPredicate((value) => value == 10),
      O.fold(
        () => IO.of(undefined), // no side effect
        () => IO.of(console.log("The value is very important!")), // conditional side effect
      ),
    );
  }, [value]);

  return pipe(
    value,
    O.fromNullable,
    O.fold(
      () => <LoadingCard />, // Output: Loading UI Card
      (value) =>
        pipe(
          value,
          E.fromPredicate(
            (value) => value !== 0, // Addition validation
            () => "Error: Value is not 0",
          ),
          E.map((value) =>
            value > 0 ? `Positive (${value})` : `Negative (${value})`, // Transform value
          ),
          E.fold(
            (error) => <ErrorCard error={error} />, // Output: Error UI Card
            (success) => <SuccessCard data={success} />, // Success UI Card
          ),
        ),
    ),
  );
};
```

### Responsive Values

When working with repsonsiveness it can sometimes be nessisary to conditionally
return values based on the screen size. This pattern allows you to do that in a
very elegant way. While its not nessisary to use fp-ts for this, it does make it
use of functional programming concepts such as currying and composition.

```ts showLineNumbers
export const foldScreenWidth =
  <T>(
    xs: (width: number) => T,
    sm?: (width: number) => T,
    md?: (width: number) => T,
    lg?: (width: number) => T,
  ) =>
  (width: number) => {
    switch (true) {
      case width > 1200 && lg !== undefined:
        return lg!(width);
      case width > 992 && md !== undefined:
        return md!(width);
      case width > 768 && sm !== undefined:
        return sm!(width);
      default:
        return xs(width);
    }
  };

const responsiveFontSize = foldScreenWidth(
  () => `1rem`, // default for xs screen
  () => `1.25rem`, // sm screen
  undefined, // md screen
  () => `2rem`, // lg screen
);
console.log(responsiveFontSize(1000)); // Output: "1.25rem"
```

This can also be done using ADTs which is a bit more elegant, but also a bit
more complicated. I've only used an ADT abstraction from
[morphic-ts](https://github.com/sledorze/morphic-ts) but dont want to add that
dependency to this project (right now).
