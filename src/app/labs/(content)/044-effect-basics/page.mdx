Every early in my development career I was introduced to functional programming
through Professor Fisby's
[Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://mostly-adequate.gitbook.io/mostly-adequate-guide)
and then the adoptions of [`fp-ts`](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and
[`io-ts`](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) in my day-to-day work. I've been
using `fp-ts` for a little over five years now and has been a fundamental part
of my development process.

I even have a whole series of lab posts from two years ago diving deeper into
the subject and improving my skills.

- [fp-ts: The Basics (Part 1)](/labs/032-fp-ts-basics)
- [fp-ts: The Practical (Part 2)](/labs/033-fp-ts-practical)
- [fp-ts: The Application (Part 3)](/labs/034-fp-ts-application)
- [fp-ts: useTaskEither (Part 4)](/labs/035-fp-ts-useTaskEither)
- [fp-ts: Under Utilized Functions (Part 5)](/labs/036-fp-ts-under-utilized)

So last year I was a little sad / apprehensive to see the
[Giulio Canti](https://gcanti.github.io/) announcement
([cabd677](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/commit/cabd6777aaf86f99740952cb66993820ea6ef564))
that `fp-ts` future development would be in the `Effect` ecosystem, and that the
`fp-ts` library would be only maintained going forward. I've put off learning
`Effect` mostly because of the resistance I already get for using `fp-ts` in my
day-to-day work. But I've decided to take the plunge and start learning `Effect`
and see how it compares to `fp-ts`.

## What is Effect?

Once you get past all the tag-lines and fluff, `Effect` is essentially a pattern
of writing code that has strong focusing on addressing the complexity of writing
applications in TypeScript/JavaScript. It's a library that provides a set of
data structures, utilities, and abstractions to make building applications
easier to write, read, test, observe, and (ultimately) maintain.

This means its kind of hard to compare when looking at "simple" examples, cause
the "simple" way of doing things is already easy. But in reality, most programs
are not made complex by the accumulation of simple things, but by continuous
creep and ambiguity of the development process and maintenance. `Effect` offers
a kind of common hand-shake between developers (past me and future me) to help
make the logic of the program more explicit, easier to understand, and
(hopefully) more maintainable.

## Overlap with fp-ts

Its easy to see the overlap when you start looking at the examples with all the
`pipe` functions, `Either` types, and `.match` function. But there are also
clear differences with how `Effect` approaches problem solving such as the more
implicit `Effect.gen` that use of JS generators to allow for a more
"conventional" look.

While I wait patiently for the `pipe` operator to be added to JavaScript
([TC39 spec](https://tc39.es/proposal-pipeline-operator/)), the `pipe` function
is still my favorite way to write code in `fp-ts` and now in `Effect`.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { pipe } from "effect";

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2;
const square = (n: number): number => n * n;
const inc = (n: number): number => n + 1;

const map =
  <T>(fn: (a: T) => T) =>
  (arr: T[]): T[] =>
    arr.map(fn);

const program = pipe(
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  map(double),
  map(inc),
  map(square),
  map(double),
  map(inc),
);

console.log(program); // <- [ 19, 51, 99, 163, 243 ]
```

This, in my mind, looks so much cleaner then:

```ts showLineNumbers
const programGen = () => {
  const values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const doubled = values.map(double);
  const incremented = doubled.map(inc);
  const squared = incremented.map(square);
  const doubled2 = squared.map(double);
  const incremented2 = doubled2.map(inc);
  return incremented2;
};

console.log(program); // <- [ 19, 51, 99, 163, 243 ]
```

## Primitives

Since I have a bunch of examples in
[fp-ts: The Basics (Part 1)](/labs/032-fp-ts-basics), this seems like a good way
to make the comparison between `fp-ts` and `Effect`. Not all the examples will
apply, but I'll jot down my thoughts for the ones that do.

### Option

`Effect` has a drop in replacement for `Option` that is very similar to `fp-ts`.
With the `pipe` function there is almost no change apart from the import and
name which is really nice for these little functions.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Option, pipe } from "effect";

const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const square = (x: number): number => x ** 2;

const result = pipe(
  Option.some(3),
  Option.map(double),
  Option.map(square),
  Option.map(double),
);

console.log(result); // Output: Some(72)
```

### Either

Very similar to `Option`, `Effect` has a near drop in replacement for `Either`.
The major caveat though is that the type signature is a little backwards. In
`fp-ts` the `Either` type is `Either<Left, Right>` where `Left` is typically an
error type and `Right` is the success type. But in `Effect` this is backwards to
match `Effect<Value, Error, Context>` pattern. This is a little confusing at
first, but once you get used to it, it's not that bad.

There are also few methods, such as the `.fromPredicate()` that need be replaces
with the `.liftPredicate()` function. But the `pipe` function is still the same.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Either, flow, pipe } from "effect";

const isPositive = (x: number): boolean => x > 0;
const isNotZero = (x: number): boolean => x !== 0;

const divide = (x: number, y: number): Either.Either<number, string> =>
  pipe(
    y,
    Either.liftPredicate(isNotZero, () => "Division by zero"),
    Either.map((y) => x / y),
  );

const squareRoot = flow(
  Either.liftPredicate<number, string>(
    isPositive,
    () => "Cannot calculate square root of a negative number",
  ),
  Either.map((x) => Math.sqrt(x)),
);

const calculate = flow(
  divide,
  Either.andThen((value) => squareRoot(value)),
);

console.log(calculate(10, 2)); // Output: Right(2.5)
console.log(calculate(10, 0)); // Output: Left(Division by zero)
console.log(calculate(-10, 2)); // Output: Left("Cannot calculate square root of a negative number")
```

### Task

This was where I thought things were going to start to get a little different.
In `fp-ts` the `Task` type is used to represent an asynchronous computation that
can fail. But in `Effect`, its more about how the `Effect` type is run using
`Effect.runPromise()`. I actually find this much easier to understand, as
figuring out when to run the `Task` in `fp-ts` was always a little tricky.

Another nice DX improvement is the object structure of the `Effect.tryPromise()`
which makes it implicit what is happening. There was also some nice validation
checks like the `parse` function below not using `.tryPromise()` since the
`JSON.parse` function is synchronous. When tried to use `.tryPromise()` it throw
an error.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Effect, pipe } from "effect";

const fetchData = (url: string) =>
  Effect.tryPromise({
    try: () => fetch(url).then((res) => res.text()),
    catch: (e) => `Error fetching data, ${String(e)}`,
  });

const parse = (str: string) =>
  Effect.try({
    try: () => JSON.parse(str),
    catch: (e) => `Error parsing data, ${String(e)}`,
  });

const stringify = (obj: unknown) =>
  Effect.tryPromise({
    try: async () => JSON.stringify(obj),
    catch: (e) => `Error stringify-ing data, ${String(e)}`,
  });

const getJson = () =>
  pipe(
    fetchData("/api/healthcheck"),
    Effect.andThen(parse),
    Effect.andThen(stringify),
    Effect.runPromise,
  );

getJson().then(console.log).catch(console.error); // Output: Right("{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-02-07T10:01:07.568Z"}")
```

## Composition

For the most part composition has already been covered with `pipe` and `flow`
working in the same way. But there are some nice additions to the `Effect`
library that make it easier to compose functions together. As well as the option
to create generators with `Effect.gen`.

### matching

Pattern matching was one place I noticed a different where the `Option.match()`
accepts an object with `onNone` and `onSome` keys. This is actually a nice
improvement and makes the code a little easier to read. The same can be said for
other functions like `Effect.catchTags()` which can map out the Error keys to a
more readable format.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { flow, Option } from "effect";

const double = (x: number): number => x * 2;
const square = (x: number): number => x ** 2;

const result = flow(
  Option.fromNullable<number>,
  Option.map(double),
  Option.map(square),
  Option.match({
    onNone: () => "No value",
    onSome: double,
  }),
);

console.log(result(3)); // Output: 72
console.log(result(undefined)); // Output: No value
```

## Conclusion

Its still early days in the adoption of `Effect`, but so far I'm enjoying
learning it and seeing how it compares to `fp-ts`. I'm not sure if I'll be able
to use it in my day-to-day work, but hopefully I can sprinkle it in here and
there to see how it goes.

There are still a bunch of things I want to explore like validation (`Schema`),
dependency injection (`Effect.Context`), and observability (`Effect.withSpan()`)
so I'm sure there will be more parts to come.
