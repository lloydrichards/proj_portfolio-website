import { Timeline } from "../../lab_modules/029";
import { ResponsiveChart } from "../../components/chart/utils/ResponsiveChart.tsx";

Followinf in the success of the **028** lab, I'm not going to use the
`@visx/brush` component to create a timeline that is automaticaly moves across
time. The idea is to have a timeline that is moving across time, and have some
controls that can be used to start and stop the timeline.

<ResponsiveChart
  className="bg-muted h-96 rounded p-4"
  render={({ width, height }) => (
    <Timeline width={width - 32} height={height - 32} />
  )}
/>

With a bit of work, I was able to get the timeline to move across time, and have
a button that can be used to start and stop the timeline. I also added forward
and rewind buttons and have a speed property which changes the number days it
jumps each tick.

## How it works

I started with the base `<Timeline />` component from **028** and added some
buttons to the bottom. These I styles and could hook into the `onClick()` to
start and stop the animation.

```tsx
const [selected, setSelected] = useState<[Date, Date]>([
  intervals[0],
  intervals[1],
]);
const [window, setWindow] = useState<[Date, Date]>([
  intervals[0],
  intervals[1],
]);
const [count, setCount] = useState<number>(0);
const [speed, setSpeed] = useState<number>(0);
```

The state is used to keep track of the selected and window intervals, the count
of the current interval, and the speed at which the timeline moves.

```tsx
const onBrushChange = (domain: Bounds | null) => {
  if (!domain) return;
  setSelected([new Date(domain.x0), new Date(domain.x1)]);
};

const ontTick = () => {
  if (!brushRef.current) return;
  brushRef.current.updateBrush((prevBrush) => {
    const newStart = addDays(window[0], speed);
    const newEnd = addDays(window[1], speed);
    const newExtent = brushRef.current!.getExtent(
      { x: xScale(newStart) },
      { x: xScale(newEnd) },
    );
    setWindow([newStart, newEnd]);
    const newState: BaseBrushState = {
      ...prevBrush,
      start: { y: newExtent.y0, x: newExtent.x0 },
      end: { y: newExtent.y1, x: newExtent.x1 },
      extent: newExtent,
    };
    return newState;
  });
};

const onReset = () => {
  setSpeed(0);
  setWindow([intervals[0], intervals[1]]);
  setSelected([intervals[0], intervals[1]]);
  setCount(0);
  if (!brushRef.current) return;
  brushRef.current.updateBrush((prevBrush) => {
    const newExtent = brushRef.current!.getExtent(
      { x: xScale(intervals[0]) },
      { x: xScale(intervals[1]) },
    );
    const newState: BaseBrushState = {
      ...prevBrush,
      start: { y: newExtent.y0, x: newExtent.x0 },
      end: { y: newExtent.y1, x: newExtent.x1 },
      extent: newExtent,
    };
    return newState;
  });
};
```

The `onBrushChange()` function is used to update the selected interval when the
brush is moved. The `onTick()` function is used to update the window interval
and move the brush. The `onReset()` function is used to reset the timeline to
the start.

```tsx
useInterval(
  () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    ontTick();
  },
  speed != 0 ? 200 : null,
);
```

The `useInterval()` hook is from
[usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com/react-hook/use-interval) is used to call
the `onTick()` function every 200ms if the speed is not 0. This is used to
animate the timeline.

## Ideas for improvement

- Add a slider to control the speed
- Add **framer motion** to smooth out the animation
- Move the animation logic into a custom hook
