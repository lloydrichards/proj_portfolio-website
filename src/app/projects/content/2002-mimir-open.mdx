For many years I had fumbled my way through creating and IoT device from the
hardware, firmware, backend, frontend and data visualization. These included the
[mimir visualization](/projects/1901-mimir-visualization) and
[mimirHome](/projects/2003-mimir-home) projects. In this project I wanted to
show the development process of the hardware that would eventually become the
mimirOpen sensor.

### mimirPrototype2

At the very beginning I was just buying off the shelf components and trying to
get them to work together. This was a very simple breadboard that was able to
record and save data. For a time, this was running without issue sending data to
a firebase backend and visualizing using the
[mimir visualization](/projects/1901-mimir-visualization).

This version include:

- `SHT31` temperature and humidity sensor
- `TSL2561` light sensor
- `ESP8266` microcontroller
- OLED display

### mimirPrototype3

Next version was my first go at designing a shield to fit on an ESP32
development board. Taking what I learnt from the sensors, I learnt to design
PCBs in a weekend and had them manufactured in China. This was a big step up
from the breadboard and allowed me to add more sensors and functionality.

This version include:

- 2x `SHT31` temperature and humidity sensor
- `TEMT600` ambient light sensor
- `VEML6030` UV sensor
- `BME280` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor

### mimirPrototype4

With the success of the first shield, I designed a second shield with more
consistent sensors, as well as an air quality sensor. Also learnt more about PCB
design and manufacturing, taking advantage of multiple layers and more complex
designs.

This design was also where I got much better ad firmware development and
understanding how to write programs in C++ for the ESP32. This allowed me to add
more states to the application to power the various LEDs for indicating the
state of the device.

This version include:

- 2x `SHT31` temperature and humidity sensor
- 2x `BH1715` light sensor
- `TEMT600` ambient light sensor
- `VEML6030` UV sensor
- `CCS811` air quality sensor
- `BME280` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- OLED display

### mimirPrototype5

After designing two shields it was time to test out creating an full development
board for a ESP32 module. This was a big step up in complexity and required a
lot more planning and testing. Here I learnt how to make power circuits, USB-C
connectors and how to layout a board for manufacturing, testing and assembly.

### mimirPrototype6

Combining all the knowledge from the previous prototypes, I designed a fully
integrated sensor board that could be used for the mimirOpen project. This was
where I started to get serious about sourcing components and designing for
manufacturing. At the time I was scaling up the number of devices I could build
with at once point receiving data from over 20 devices, all hand build.

This version include:

- `SHT31` temperature and humidity sensor
- `BME360` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- `HSCDT008A` compass
- `VEML6030` UV sensor
- `BME280` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- `ESP32-WROOM` microcontroller

This was also the first time designing 3D printed cases for the devices. This
allowed me to test out different configurations and how the devices would be
mounted in the final product.

## mimirOpen

After much prototyping and an attempt to create a startup around the device, I
eventually started putting all my learnings into a more formal repository of
content in an effort to open source the project.

Final version include:

- `SHT31` temperature and humidity sensor
- `BME360` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- `LSM303` compass
- `VEML6030` UV sensor
- `BME280` temperature, humidity and pressure sensor
- `ESP32-WROOM` microcontroller

![Schematic diagram of board](/images/projects/2002/mimir_open-schematic.png)

This was where I swapped from EasyEDA to KiCAD for designing the PCBs. This
allowed me to have a proper git version control system for the hardware and
firmware changes so I could track the progress over time. This repository is
still alive, but not active at all.

Was also a time where I was experimenting more with the vision of a product for
this device so for time designed some shiny renders of the device.

## Future Prototypes

Since creating the mimirOpen project I have been working on a new version of the
device that is more modular and can be used in a variety of different
configurations. This is the mimirCUBE project. There is a private repository of
all the hardware, firmware and software for this project, but I'm still unsure
If I will make it public.

![Mini prototypes for different cub forms](/images/projects/2002/mimir_proto_7.jpg)

This project was a lot of fun to design and learn from. I got to apply a real
example of the problems with IoT development and learn how to overcome them. I
also got to learn a lot about PCB design and manufacturing, as well as how to
design for a product that could be used by others. I also got to learn a lot
about PCB design and manufacturing, as well as how to design for a product that
could be used by others.

While I'm sure there will never be a commercial version of this device, I'm
happy to have learnt so much from the process and understand the complexities of
creating a product from scratch.
