This is a continuation of the previous post on bubble packing. In this post, we
will optimize the bubble packing algorithm to reduce the number of iterations
required to find a stable layout.

<OptimizedNestedBubblePacking data={MockBubbles} />

Above is a more optimized example where the layoutSimulation is first created
and stored in useState. Next, the nodeSimulator is creates and stored in another
useState and the nodeSimulator is updated each time the layoutSimulation is
updated. This reduces the number of iterations required to find a stable layout.
It also creates a smooth animation as the bubbles are settling at the same time.

### How it Works

The `OptimizedNestedBubblePacking` component is similar to the
`NestedBubblePacking` component from the previous post. The only difference is
that the `OptimizedNestedBubblePacking` component uses `useState` to store the
layoutSimulation and nodeSimulation. The `useState` hook is used to store the
layoutSimulation and nodeSimulation because we want to re-render the component
each time the layoutSimulation is updated. This will allow us to animate the
bubbles as they settle into their final positions.

```jsx
const [layout, setLayout] = useState([]);
const [layoutSimulation, setLayoutSimulation] = useState();
const [nodeSimulation, setNodeSimulation] = useState();

// Create the layoutSimulation
useEffect(() => {
  const simulation = forceSimulation();
  setLayoutSimulation(simulation);
}, []);

// Update the layoutSimulation
useEffect(() => {
  if (!layoutSimulation) return;
  layoutSimulator.nodes(topics);
  layoutSimulator.on("tick", () => {
    layoutSimulator.tick(1);
    setLayout([...layoutSimulator.nodes()]);
  });
}, [layoutSimulation, topics]);
```

## Bubble Machine

To further experiment with the `OptimizedNestedBubblePacking` component, I
created a bubble machine that stores the state of the MockBubbles and allows me
to add and remove bubbles from the machine. By clicking on the `Add Bubble`
button a new bubble will be created from the right and when clicking
`Remove Bubble` the last bubble is removed.

<BubbleMachine />

The result is a smooth animation of the bubbles as they settle into their final
positions. As the data changes, the bubbles will animate to their new positions.
As the simulation winds down, the bubbles will slow down and eventually stop
moving.

What is left now if figuring out how to animate out the bubbles as they are
removed. I've tried using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to
animate the exit of the bubbles but I haven't been able to get it to work. I'll
continue to experiment with it and hopefully I'll have an update in the next
post or two.
