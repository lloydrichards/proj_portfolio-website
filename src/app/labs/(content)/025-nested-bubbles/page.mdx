import { NestedBubblePacking, MockBubbles } from "./025";

With an idea on how D3 force layout works, I wanted to try to nest bubbles in
bubbles. The broad stroked of the idea is to have a parent bubble that contains
child bubbles. There will be two simulations, one for the parent that will
calculate the center of a topic and a seocnd for the child which will calculate
the force on the child based on their topic type.

<NestedBubblePacking data={MockBubbles} />

With the nesting bubbles i'm basically running two simulations at once. The
first calcualtes the center of the topic area and updates the `layout` property
with the x and y coord. Using the sum of all the elements by type its possible
to effect the radius of the area within the `collide` force.

```typescript
// Node Simulator
useEffect(() => {
  const nodeSim = forceSimulation()
    .alphaMin(0.1)
    .force(
      "forceX",
      forceX<SimulationNodeDatum & Partial<Node>>(
        (d) => layout.find((e) => e.type == d.type)?.x || width / 2,
      ),
    )
    .force(
      "forceY",
      forceY<SimulationNodeDatum & Partial<Node>>(
        (d) => layout.find((e) => e.type == d.type)?.y || width / 2,
      ),
    )
    .force("charge", forceManyBody())
    .force(
      "collide",
      forceCollide<Node>()
        .strength(0.5)
        .radius((d) => d.count + 10),
    );

  nodeSim.on("tick", () => {
    nodeSim.tick(1);
    setNodes([...nodeSim.nodes()]);
  });
  nodeSim.nodes([
    ...data.map((d) => ({ ...d, color: topicColor(d.type || "SPORT") })),
  ]);

  nodeSim.alpha(0.8).restart();

  return () => {
    nodeSim.stop();
  };
}, [data, layout]);
```

Then for the nested items, another simulation runs to and applies the `xForce`
and `yForce` based on the location of the `layout`. The result currently is a
bit of delayed calculation where the layout needs to settle first before the
nested ones can more, but I think this can be fixed by moving the `nodeSim` into
its own state.
